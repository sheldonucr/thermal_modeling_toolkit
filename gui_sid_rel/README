This gui includes linear system identification and piecewise linear system identification

Linear system identification

1. Create the data file for identification. Save the input as 'u_p_vec' and output as 'y_temp_vec'; the time is saved as 't' into a mat file.
     ex:
       u_p_vec = inputpower(dimension, time_points);
       y_temp_vec = inputpower(dimension, time_points); 
       save('prbs.mat', 'u_p_vec', 'y_temp_vec','t');

2. Type sid_temp to start the gui

3. Double click the data file to download the data for identification

4. Specify the order and the time point used for training the system

5. Specify the SID method in the pull-down selection

6. Click RUNSID

7. Specify output ports to plot the transient output 

8. Specify input-output pair to plot bodeplot and print transfer function. 


Piecewise linear system identification

Using the same procedure from step 1 to step 7, except that:
  a) in step 4, you need to specify the data length to identify each sub-model and the data points shared by the two adjacent sub-models. 
  b) step 5 is omitted for piecewise system identification because only N4SID is used in this method 
  c) bode plot and transfer function print is disabled if using this method
